Welcome to the **Deep MicroVision Lab** at Beijing Institute of Technology.

The Deep MicroVision Lab develops theoretical foundations and computational
methods for next-generation microscopy and imaging systems.

Our research integrates signal processing, machine learning, and computational
imaging to address fundamental challenges in high-resolution imaging under
extreme noise and limited measurements.

## Research Areas

- Cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction
- Phase retrieval and inverse problems
- Computational microscopy
- Physics-informed deep learning
- Imaging under low-dose conditions

## Join Us

We are actively recruiting motivated students and research assistants.
Interested candidates are encouraged to contact Dr. Yixiao Yang.
