Deep MicroVision Lab

The Deep MicroVision Lab at Beijing Institute of Technology develops
theoretical foundations and computational methods for next-generation
microscopy and imaging systems.

Our research integrates signal processing, machine learning, and
computational imaging to address fundamental challenges in
high-resolution imaging under extreme noise and limited measurements.

Current research focuses include:

• Cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction
• Phase retrieval and inverse problems
• Computational microscopy
• Physics-informed deep learning
• Imaging under low-dose and photon-limited conditions

We aim to push the limits of imaging resolution, robustness, and efficiency
for scientific discovery and biomedical applications.
