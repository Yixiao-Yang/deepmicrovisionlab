Welcome to the **Deep MicroVision Lab** at **Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)**.

We develop **theoretical foundations** and **computational methods** for next-generation microscopy and imaging systems.  
Our work integrates **signal processing**, **machine learning**, and **computational imaging** to enable high-resolution reconstruction under **extreme noise** and **limited measurements**.

## Research Highlights
- **Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)**: phase retrieval and reconstruction under low-dose imaging conditions  
- **Computational microscopy**: lens-free and phase imaging, physical forward modeling  
- **Inverse problems & learning**: physics-informed deep learning, optimization-inspired networks  
- **Photon-/dose-limited imaging**: robust algorithms and uncertainty-aware inference

## News
- (2026-02) Deep MicroVision Lab website is launched.

## Join Us
We are actively recruiting **PhD students, Master students, and research assistants**.  
If you are interested, please contact **Dr. Yixiao Yang** (yangyixiao@bit.edu.cn) via email with your **CV** and a brief description of your research interests.
