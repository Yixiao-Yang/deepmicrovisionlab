Our research focuses on the intersection of **computational imaging**, **signal processing**, and **machine learning**.

## 1) Cryo-Electron Microscopy Reconstruction
We study phase recovery and reconstruction under low-dose imaging conditions, aiming to improve robustness and enable higher-resolution structural biology.

**Topics**
- phase recovery / phase retrieval for cryo-EM micrographs and movies  
- modeling CTF effects and zero-crossings  
- noise-aware reconstruction and uncertainty quantification  

## 2) Computational Microscopy
We develop physical forward models and reconstruction algorithms for lens-free and phase imaging, targeting wide FOV, high resolution, and efficient computation.

**Topics**
- diffraction-based imaging and propagation modeling  
- ptychography and near-field imaging  
- adaptive sampling and high-NA computational imaging  

## 3) Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Inverse Problems
We build learning systems that respect imaging physics and remain reliable across conditions.

**Topics**
- optimization-inspired networks (unrolled / plug-and-play)  
- controllable / parameterized models for varying imaging settings  
- generalization under distribution shift  

## 4) Imaging Under Low-Dose / Photon-Starved Conditions
We investigate modeling and algorithms for extreme-noise regimes.

**Topics**
- Poisson-Gaussian noise modeling  
- dose weighting and motion effects  
- robust training objectives and evaluation protocols
